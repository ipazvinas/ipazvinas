- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ivan Paz-Vinas @ipazvinas
- ðŸ‘€ I am a molecular ecologist and conservation geneticist interested in how the genetic variation of multiple species is distributed in space and time: Are there general patterns of genetic variation? Which processes influence them? What are their implications for biodiversity conservation? 
- ðŸŒ± With colleagues from the Powell Center Conservation Genetics / Genomics Working Group, I'm currently aiming at tackling these questions using macrogenetic approaches
